JUDGMENT
(Delivered by AHMED MOHAMMED, J)

This action was instituted by the Federal Government of Nigeria against Shell Petroleum Development Company, seeking declarations relating to environmental damage in the Niger Delta region, specifically concerning oil spills that occurred between 2018 and 2020.

The plaintiff's case is that the defendant, as an operator of several oil wells and pipelines in the Niger Delta region, has failed to properly maintain its facilities, resulting in numerous oil spills that have caused environmental degradation, loss of livelihood for local communities, and pollution of water sources.
