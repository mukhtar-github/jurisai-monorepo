Based on my exploration of the monorepo, I've gathered a comprehensive understanding of the JurisAI project:

Project Overview: JurisAI
JurisAI is an AI-powered legal assistant designed specifically for legal professionals and individuals in Nigeria and Africa. The platform aims to simplify legal workflows through automation, providing services like legal research, document drafting, compliance guidance, and case summarization.

Core Components:
Architecture:
Monorepo structure with separate apps, libraries, and infrastructure
Uses Bazel as a build system
Follows modern development practices with CI/CD pipelines
Backend:
Built with FastAPI
Uses PostgreSQL for structured data storage
Implements Redis for caching frequently accessed queries
Organized into core, models, and routes directories
Frontend:
React-based user interface
Responsive design using TailwindCSS or Material-UI
Also includes a Progressive Web App (PWA) component
AI Integration:
Utilizes Hugging Face pre-trained models fine-tuned on African legal datasets
Implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines for document retrieval
Uses FAISS for efficient similarity search
Models are optimized for performance with techniques like ONNX Runtime quantization
Infrastructure:
Containerized with Docker
Terraform configurations for cloud deployment (AWS)
Ansible for configuration management
Initially deployed on Railway with plans to migrate to AWS EC2 for GPU workloads
Key Features:
Legal Research Assistant:
Natural language search for statutes, cases, and regulations
Jurisdiction-specific document retrieval
Summarization of legal documents
Document Drafting Assistant:
AI-powered drafting for contracts, NDAs, and agreements
Templates customized for specific jurisdictions
Compliance Guidance Assistant:
Industry-specific compliance recommendations
Tailored to local regulations
Data Management:
Custom Legal Data Management API for ingestion and standardization
Support for multiple file formats
Efficient storage and retrieval systems
Development Roadmap:
The project is being developed in three phases:

Proof of Concept (POC) (2-3 weeks):
Basic functionality to validate feasibility
Core ingestion pipeline and search functionality
Simple deployment on Railway
Prototype (4-6 weeks):
End-to-end functionality demonstration
Advanced search and AI summarization
React frontend with basic user interface
Minimum Viable Product (MVP) (6-8 weeks):
Full integration of all components
User authentication and personalization
Performance optimizations
Potential migration to AWS for GPU workloads
Technical Specifics:
Uses FastAPI for backend API endpoints
PostgreSQL with GIN indexing for efficient text search
Redis for caching to improve performance
Hugging Face models optimized with ONNX Runtime
FAISS vector database for document similarity search
React frontend with intuitive UI components
Docker containerization for deployment
CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions
The project appears well-structured with a clear vision, technical specifications, and implementation roadmap, focusing on creating a specialized legal AI assistant tailored for African jurisdictions.
