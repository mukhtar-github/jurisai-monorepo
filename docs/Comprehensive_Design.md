### **Comprehensive Design Document and Implementation Guidelines for the Unified Project**

The unified project integrates the **Custom Legal Data Management API** into **JurisAI**, creating a robust AI-powered legal assistant tailored for professionals in Nigeria and Africa. Below is the design document and implementation roadmap divided into three stages: Proof of Concept (POC), Prototype, and Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

---

## **1. Proof of Concept (POC)**

**Objective**: Answer the question, *"Can it work?"*
The goal of this stage is to validate the feasibility of integrating the Custom Legal Data API into JurisAI.

### **Key Features in POC**

- **Custom Legal Data API**:
    - Ingest legal documents from sources like Laws.Africa, AfricanLII, and vLex Nigeria.
    - Standardize documents into Akoma Ntoso XML or JSON formats with metadata.
    - Implement basic search functionality (`/search` endpoint) using PostgreSQL’s full-text search.
- **JurisAI Core Features**:
    - Integrate RAG pipelines for retrieving legal documents.
    - Use Hugging Face embeddings for indexing and querying data.


### **Technical Implementation**

#### **1. Backend Development**

- Set up a monorepo structure for JurisAI:

```
jurisai-monorepo/
├── apps/
│   ├── backend/               # FastAPI service
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   │   ├── core/         # Authentication, middleware
│   │   │   ├── routes/       # API endpoints
│   │   │   └── models/       # Database schemas
```

- Add ingestion pipeline in `apps/backend/src/routes/ingestion.py`:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, String, Text
class LegalDocument(Base):
    __tablename__ = "legal_documents"
    id = Column(String, primary_key=True)
    content = Column(Text)
    jurisdiction = Column(String(50))
```

- Implement `/search` endpoint using PostgreSQL’s GIN indexing:

```python
@router.get("/search")
async def search(query: str):
    results = db.query(LegalDocument).filter(LegalDocument.content.ilike(f"%{query}%")).all()
    return results
```


#### **2. AI Pipeline**

- Use FAISS for document similarity search:

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
vector_store = FAISS.load_local("legal_index")
```


#### **3. Deployment**

- Deploy on Railway for rapid iteration:
    - PostgreSQL: Store ingested documents.
    - Redis: Cache frequently queried results.

---

## **2. Prototype**

**Objective**: Answer the question, *"How will it work?"*
The prototype demonstrates how the system will function end-to-end, focusing on usability and scalability.

### **Key Features in Prototype**

1. **Legal Document Ingestion**:
    - Automate ingestion from government gazettes and repositories.
    - Standardize documents into Akoma Ntoso XML.
2. **Search and Retrieval**:
    - Implement advanced search filters (e.g., by jurisdiction or date range).
3. **AI-Powered Summarization**:
    - Use Hugging Face models to summarize retrieved legal documents.
4. **Frontend Integration**:
    - Build a React-based dashboard for user interactions.

### **Technical Implementation**

#### **1. Backend Enhancements**

- Extend ingestion pipeline to support metadata extraction:

```python
metadata = {
    "jurisdiction": "Nigeria",
    "publication_date": "2025-02-01",
    "document_type": "Gazette"
}
```

- Add summarization endpoint using Hugging Face models:

```python
@router.post("/summarize")
async def summarize(document_id: str):
    document = db.query(LegalDocument).filter_by(id=document_id).first()
    summary = summarization_model(document.content)
    return {"summary": summary}
```


#### **2. Frontend Development**

- Create a React-based dashboard with the following features:
    - Search bar for querying legal texts.
    - Upload button for users to add new legal documents.
- Example directory structure:

```
frontend/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── components/
  │   ├── pages/
  │       ├── SearchPage.jsx
  │       ├── UploadPage.jsx
```


#### **3. Deployment**

- Use Docker to containerize backend and frontend services.
- Deploy on Railway with CI/CD pipelines configured via GitHub Actions.

---

## **3. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

**Objective**: Answer the question, *"Does it solve a problem?"*
The MVP validates whether the unified system addresses user needs effectively.

### **Key Features in MVP**

1. **Full Integration of Custom Legal Data API**:
    - Advanced ingestion pipeline with error handling for malformed data.
    - Support for multiple file formats (e.g., `.txt`, `.json`, `.xml`).
2. **User Authentication**:
    - Allow users to create accounts and access personalized data storage.
3. **Compliance Guidance Assistant**:
    - Provide tailored compliance recommendations based on jurisdiction-specific laws.
4. **Optimized Performance**:
    - Cache queries using Redis to reduce response times.
5. **Scalability**:
    - Migrate to AWS EC2 for GPU-based workloads if user demand increases.

### **Technical Implementation**

#### **1. Backend Enhancements**

- Add user authentication using FastAPI’s OAuth2 integration:

```python
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")

@router.get("/user/profile")
async def get_profile(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    user = decode_token(token)
    return {"username": user.username}
```


#### **2. AI Model Optimization**

- Quantize Hugging Face models using ONNX Runtime to reduce latency.


#### **3. Frontend Enhancements**

- Add user authentication flows (login/register).
- Create dashboards for compliance guidance and document management.


#### **4. Deployment Strategy**

- Migrate to AWS EC2 with Terraform configurations for GPU workloads if latency exceeds acceptable thresholds or concurrent users surpass system capacity.
