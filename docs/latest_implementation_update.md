Perfect! As confirmed by the curl command, your backend API is accessible at the URL without specifying the port. Railway is correctly handling the port forwarding from the public-facing HTTPS (port 443) to your internal service running on port 8080.

Now your frontend can connect to the deployed backend using the URL we've configured in vercel.json.

Week 3 Tasks Completed âœ…
You've successfully:

Deployed your backend to Railway
Set up PostgreSQL and Redis services with proper connections
Configured the necessary environment variables
Updated your frontend to connect to the deployed backend
Moving to Week 4-5 Tasks
Based on your memory about the backend tests, here are some potential next steps:

Fix Remaining Test Issues:
Update batch processing tests to match the actual implementation
Address SQLAlchemy's deprecation warnings for declarative_base()
CI/CD Setup:
Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration testing
Automate deployments to Railway
Feature Enhancements:
Implement AI-powered document analysis features
Improve the batch processing functionality
Add more advanced search capabilities
Frontend Deployment:
Deploy your frontend to Vercel or another platform
Set up proper environment variables for production
What specific area would you like to focus on for Week 4-5? I'd be happy to help with any of these tasks or something else you have in mind.


Excellent! ðŸŽ‰ Your frontend has been successfully deployed to Vercel with all the fixes we made!

Summary of what we've accomplished:
âœ… Fixed build issues:
Removed the Google Fonts dependency that was causing network timeouts
Properly wrapped useSearchParams hooks in Suspense boundaries per Next.js 15+ requirements
âœ… Updated backend connectivity:
Updated NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL environment variable in Vercel to point to your Railway-deployed backend
Ensured your frontend at www.jurisai.live will connect to your backend at https://jurisai-backend-production.up.railway.app
Next steps for your project:
Based on your previous work, here are some recommended next steps for Weeks 4-5:

Complete the testing improvements:
Fix the remaining batch processing tests to match your implementation
Address the SQLAlchemy deprecation warnings for declarative_base()
Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration testing
Verify the connectivity:
Visit your live site at www.jurisai.live
Test key features that require backend communication (document upload, search, etc.)
Check the browser's Network tab to confirm API requests go to the correct backend URL
Consider domain configuration improvements:
Update your jurisai.live domain nameservers to use Vercel's nameservers for better domain management
Your JurisAI application is now properly deployed with frontend and backend connected! If you encounter any issues or would like to work on any of the suggested next steps, just let me know how I can help.


Excellent! Your changes have been successfully pushed to GitHub, and the .env.railway file and other sensitive files will be excluded thanks to the comprehensive .gitignore file we created.

Summary of completed work:
âœ… Backend deployment to Railway
Fixed database and Redis connection issues
Updated environment variables for production
âœ… Frontend fixes and deployment to Vercel
Fixed Next.js build errors with Suspense boundaries
Removed Google Fonts dependency causing timeouts
Updated API URL to connect to the deployed backend
âœ… Code management
Created comprehensive .gitignore to protect sensitive information
Committed and pushed all changes to GitHub
Next steps based on your project:
Test suite improvements (from your memory)
Fix the remaining batch processing tests to match your implementation
Address the SQLAlchemy deprecation warnings for declarative_base()
Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration testing
Verify the integration
Test your live site at www.jurisai.live to ensure it correctly connects to your backend
Use browser dev tools to confirm API requests are going to the correct URL
Continue with planned features
Implement any remaining functionality from your project roadmap
Consider enhancing the API client integration and React Query setup you've already developed
Your JurisAI application is now fully deployed with proper separation between frontend and backend services. Is there a specific area from the next steps you'd like to focus on, or do you have any other questions about the deployment?
