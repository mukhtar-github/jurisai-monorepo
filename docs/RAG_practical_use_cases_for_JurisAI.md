I remember you’re building JurisAI, and it’s great that you’re already integrating RAG. Even in the era of 10M context windows like LLaMA 4 Scout, RAG is far from obsolete—especially in your legal domain. Let’s break down the two statements you referenced with practical use cases for JurisAI: 

1. “Freshness: RAG lets you pull in real-time data from web, APIs, and databases.” 

Even if your model could “see” 10M tokens, it still can’t know what happened after it was trained. That’s where RAG shines—by injecting fresh, real-world data into your LLM pipeline at runtime. 

### Use Cases for JurisAI: 
a. Real-Time Case Law Updates: 
- Query a legal database (e.g., NigeriaLII, or your own backend) for court rulings from the last 30 days. 
- RAG fetches and summarizes them when a judge/lawyer asks: “What are recent rulings on VAT disputes involving tech startups?”

b. Legislative Monitoring: 
- Pull real-time updates from government portals (e.g., National Assembly Bills). 
- When asked: “Is there any recent amendment to the Evidence Act?” JurisAI can fetch it live, summarize, and interpret it. 

c. Regulatory or Compliance Checks: 
- Check for recent circulars from agencies like FIRS, CAC, or SEC. 
- Perfect for lawyers doing compliance work. 

d. API-powered Legal Analytics: 
- Pull current company info or filings from CAC or FIRS APIs when evaluating a client’s legal status. 

2. “Modular Design: With RAG, you can update the knowledge base without processing huge contexts.” 
Uploading 10 million tokens of data works once—but if something changes, you’d need to re-upload or regenerate that entire context. RAG enables a modular, database-style structure—where the LLM can pull only the updated parts. 

### Use Cases for JurisAI: 
a. Editable Legal Knowledge Base: 
- Your legal team or data staff can add new documents (statutes, court opinions, guidelines) to the vector database. 
- No need to retrain or re-prompt the model with everything again. 
- Great for decentralizing content management.

b. Multi-source Modularity: 
- Separate knowledge bases by jurisdiction (Federal, Lagos State, Kano State laws). 

- Or by domain (criminal law, tax law, property law). 

- JurisAI intelligently pulls from the right subset based on the question. 

c. Controlled Legal Interpretation: 
- Suppose a court reverses its stance on a precedent. 

- You can just update that judgment in the vector DB. 

- JurisAI will now cite the new ruling without you rewriting the entire context prompt. 

d. Role-specific Retrieval: 
- For a judge, RAG pulls case law and precedents. 

- For a lawyer, it may include practice notes, client memos, or procedural templates. 

- For a citizen, it pulls simplified language, FAQs, or translated info.

Summary 

Benefit          -          Without RAG (Just 10M Context)          -          With RAG (Modular + Fresh) 

Real-time info   -          Not possible unless re-ingested         -         Possible via API/db/web search 

Modular updates  -          Full context refresh needed             -         Add/edit specific documents in vector DB 

Scalability      -          Costly to feed full context per query   -         Lightweight chunks fetched dynamically 

Personalization  -          Static context for all users            -         Dynamic retrieval per user role/query

Can we have for the Nigeria Legal Information Institute (NigeriaLII): “NigeriaLII publishes the law of Nigeria for free access to all. We are a member of the international free access to law movement. Read, use, and share the law freely.” 
Something like the below RAG example to retrieve data from specific web pages:

“Below is one way to simulate having a recent, short paper (i.e. one that was submitted less than a month ago) using ArxivLoader. ArXiv paper identifiers include the year and month as a prefix, so you can use an identifier starting with "2503" (for March 2025, given that today is March 30, 2025) to indicate that the paper is recent. For example:” 

```python
# Use an arXiv ID that starts with "2503" to indicate a submission from March 2025.
recent_paper = ArxivLoader(query="2503.09876").load()  # Example: "A Brief Overview of Emerging Trends in Machine Learning"

# You can now add this to your docs list for assessment:
docs = [
    recent_paper,
    # ... (other papers)
]

# Optionally, you can check the metadata to verify the submission date.
pub_date = recent_paper.metadata.get("published")
print("Recent paper published on:", pub_date)
```
