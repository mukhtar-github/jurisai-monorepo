## **Updated Documentation for "JurisAI"**

## **Updated Design Document**

### **Introduction**

**Overview**:
JurisAI is an AI-powered legal assistant tailored to simplify legal workflows for professionals and individuals. The platform leverages advanced NLP technologies and pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver efficient solutions for legal research, document drafting, compliance guidance, and case summarization. With a focus on jurisdiction-specific needs, particularly in Nigeria and Africa, JurisAI bridges the gap between complex legal tasks and accessible solutions.

**Objectives**:

- Provide rapid access to legal information across jurisdictions.
- Automate repetitive legal tasks to save time and reduce costs.
- Ensure compliance with local regulations through tailored guidance.

## **Updated Implementation Guide**

### **Backend Development**

1. Use FastAPI to handle API endpoints securely and efficiently.
2. Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed queries or documents.
3. Optimize PostgreSQL database indexing for faster query processing.

### **Frontend Development**

1. Build a React-based interface with intuitive navigation and dashboards.
2. Integrate drag-and-drop functionality for document uploads.
3. Add widgets for recent activity tracking and pending tasks.

### **AI Integration**

1. Fine-tune Hugging Face pre-trained models (e.g., GPT, T5) with legal datasets specific to Nigerian/African jurisdictions.
2. Implement Named Entity Recognition (NER) models to extract critical entities like case numbers or statutory references.
3. Test AI outputs against benchmark datasets to ensure accuracy.

### **Deployment**

1. Use Docker containers with GPU support for scalable deployment.
2. Host on AWS or Azure with CI/CD pipelines for seamless updates.
3. Monitor system performance using tools like Prometheus or Grafana.

## **Proof of Concept (POC)**

The POC will demonstrate JurisAI's capabilities through a subset of its features:

### **Features Demonstrated**

1. **Legal Research Assistant**:
    - Users can input queries like "Summarize recent Nigerian labor law rulings."
    - The system retrieves relevant documents using RAG pipelines and generates summaries.
2. **Document Drafting Assistant**:
    - Provide an NDA template that users can customize by filling placeholders like party names or dates.
3. **Case Summarization Assistant**:
    - Upload a sample court ruling PDF; the system extracts key arguments, decisions, and precedents.
4. **Compliance Guidance Assistant**:
    - Offer a checklist of compliance requirements tailored to an industry (e.g., healthcare).

### **Technical Setup**

1. Backend: Deploy FastAPI with Redis caching and PostgreSQL storage on a cloud instance (e.g., AWS EC2).
2. AI Models: Use Hugging Face pre-trained models fine-tuned on a small dataset of African legal texts as specified in "Legalai.pdf."
3. Frontend: Build a simple React interface allowing users to upload documents, input queries, and view results.
