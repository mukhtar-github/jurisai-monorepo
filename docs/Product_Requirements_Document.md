4. **Text Compression \& Storage**:
    - Compress legal texts using the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm.
    - Store compressed files in PostgreSQL with Base64 encoding for efficient retrieval.
    - Support multiple file formats (e.g., `.txt`, `.json`, `.xml`).
5. **Data Ingestion Pipeline**:
    - Automatically ingest legal documents from sources like Laws.Africa and AfricanLII.
    - Standardize documents into Akoma Ntoso XML or JSON formats with rich metadata.
6. **Search \& Retrieval API**:
    - Expose endpoints to query legal texts by keyword, citation, or jurisdiction.
    - Retrieve documents in multiple formats (XML, HTML, PDF).

## **4. Workflow**

### **4.1 User Interaction**

- Users register/login via a secure portal.
- They can upload documents or query the system through an intuitive dashboard.


### **4.2 Processing Pipelines**

1. Uploaded documents are processed by the ingestion pipeline and stored in PostgreSQL.
2. Queries are handled by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines powered by pre-trained LLMs.
3. Outputs such as summaries or drafts are generated in real-time.

### **4.3 Output Delivery**

- Results are displayed on the platform's interface or available for download in multiple formats.

- Cloud Storage: AWS S3 for large files like PDFs or backups.


### **5.2 AI Integration**

- Models: Hugging Face pre-trained models fine-tuned on African legal datasets.
- Pipelines: RAG pipelines with FAISS indexing for efficient document retrieval.


### **5.3 Frontend Development**

- Framework: React with TailwindCSS/Material-UI for responsive design.


### **5.4 Compression Algorithm**

- Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) for text compression.
- Base64 encoding for storing compressed files in PostgreSQL.

## **6. Features \& Functionalities**

| Feature | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Legal Text Ingestion | Fetches raw data from repositories like Laws.Africa and standardizes it |
| Advanced Search | Allows users to query legal texts by keyword, citation, or jurisdiction |
| Document Retrieval | Retrieves specific legal documents in XML, HTML, or PDF format |
| Metadata Retrieval | Provides metadata like publication date, jurisdiction, and document type |
| AI-Powered Summarization | Summarizes retrieved legal documents using pre-trained models |

| Text Compression | Compresses uploaded text/documents using BPE |
| File Upload \& Retrieval | Supports file uploads (.txt/.json/.xml) and retrieval of compressed files |

---

## **7. Development Roadmap**

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (POC)

**Objective:** Validate feasibility of core functionalities
Tasks:

1. Build ingestion pipeline to fetch and standardize legal texts into Akoma Ntoso XML format.
2. Implement BPE compression/decompression functionality in FastAPI.
3. Create a basic `/search` endpoint using PostgreSQL’s full-text search capabilities.

**Duration:** 2–3 weeks

---

### Phase 2: Prototype

**Objective:** Demonstrate end-to-end functionality
Tasks:

1. Add summarization endpoint using Hugging Face models.
2. Build a React-based frontend with a search bar and upload functionality.
3. Extend `/search` endpoint with advanced filters (e.g., jurisdiction/date range).
4. Implement file upload support (.txt/.json/.xml) with Base64 encoding in PostgreSQL.

**Duration:** 4–6 weeks

---

### Phase 3: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**Objective:** Deliver a working product that solves real-world problems
Tasks:

1. Integrate user authentication via OAuth2 for personalized storage/retrieval of data.
2. Add compliance guidance assistant with industry-specific recommendations.
3. Optimize performance using Redis caching and ONNX Runtime model quantization.
4. Deploy on Railway for rapid iteration; migrate to AWS EC2 if GPU workloads are required.

**Duration:** 6–8 weeks

---

## **8. Success Metrics**

| Metric | Target |
| :-- | :-- |
| Search Latency | < 2 seconds per query |
| Compression Efficiency | Reduce text size by at least 50% |
| User Retention | > 70% of users return within a month |
| Query Accuracy | > 90% accuracy in retrieving relevant documents |

---

## **9. Security Considerations**

1. Input Validation: Prevent injection attacks by sanitizing user inputs.
2. Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data stored in PostgreSQL and AWS S3.
3. Rate Limiting: Use Redis to prevent abuse of API resources by limiting requests per user/session.

---

## **10. Deployment Strategy**

### Initial Deployment

Platform: Railway
Advantages:

- Preconfigured services (PostgreSQL/Redis) reduce setup time.
- Free tier supports prototype testing with minimal costs.


### Scaling

Platform: AWS EC2
Triggers:

- Concurrent user load exceeds 50 active sessions.
- GPU workloads required for larger models (>7B parameters).
