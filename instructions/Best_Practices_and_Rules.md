# Best Practices for Implementing JurisAI
Based on the implementation plans for the JurisAI project, here are key best practices and rules that should be followed:

## Architecture & Code Organization
### 1. Monorepo Discipline
- Strictly maintain separation of concerns between packages
- Establish clear dependency boundaries between modules
- Use tooling like Nx or Turborepo to manage the monorepo efficiently
### 2. Consistent Code Style
- Implement linting across all codebases with ESLint, Prettier, and Black
- Create shared config files for consistent style enforcement
- Set up pre-commit hooks to ensure code style compliance
### 3. Modular Design
- Build features as isolated, reusable modules
- Avoid tight coupling between components
- Use dependency injection patterns where appropriate

## Development Workflow
### 4. Trunk-Based Development
- Keep feature branches short-lived (max 2-3 days)
- Implement feature flags for long-running developments
- Require code reviews for all changes
### 5. Test-Driven Development
- Write tests before implementation for critical components
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for legal data processing
- Implement different test types:
    - Unit tests for business logic
    - Integration tests for API endpoints
    - E2E tests for critical user flows
### 6. Documentation-As-Code
- Document all APIs with OpenAPI specification
- Include JSDoc/docstrings for all public functions
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes

## Security & Legal Compliance
### 7. Zero-Trust Security Model
- Validate all inputs on both client and server
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks
- Use HTTPS for all communications
### 8. Privacy by Design
- Implement data minimization practices
- Provide clear audit logs for all sensitive operations
- Design systems with GDPR and local privacy regulations in mind
### 9. Legal Data Integrity
- Implement validation for legal documents
- Add checksums/hashes for document versioning
- Create audit trails for all document modifications

## Performance & Scalability
### 10. Optimization Strategy
- Optimize for mobile-first performance
- Implement progressive loading patterns
- Use server-side rendering for content-heavy pages
### 11. Caching Strategy
- Cache heavily-used legal references
- Implement tiered caching (Redis + Browser)
- Use stale-while-revalidate patterns for legal content
### 12. Database Efficiency
- Use proper indexing for legal document searching
- Implement query optimization for complex legal queries
- Consider sharding for jurisdiction-specific data

## AI & Model Management
### 13. Model Versioning
- Track all AI model versions in a registry
- Implement A/B testing for model improvements
- Have a rollback strategy for problematic models
### 14. Explainability
- Document model limitations and biases
- Provide confidence scores with AI-generated legal content
- Implement explainability tools for complex legal recommendations
### 15. Ethical AI Practices
- Regularly audit model outputs for bias
- Implement human review for sensitive legal recommendations
- Create clear disclaimers for AI-generated content

## DevOps & Deployment
### 16. Infrastructure as Code
- Use Terraform for all infrastructure provisioning
- Document all environment variables
- Implement environment parity (dev/staging/prod)
### 17. CI/CD Pipeline
- Automate testing for all commits
- Implement staged deployments
- Use canary releases for risky changes
### 18. Monitoring & Observability
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Set up alerting for critical system failures
- Create dashboards for key performance metrics

## Project Management
### 19. Phased Implementation
- Strictly follow the POC → Prototype → MVP sequence
- Define clear success metrics for each phase
- Get stakeholder sign-off before moving to next phase
### 20. Regular Technical Debt Management
- Schedule regular refactoring sessions
- Track technical debt in issue tracker
- Allocate 20% of development time to maintenance
